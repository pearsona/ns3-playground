# Quantum Networking Playground (ns-3 + qpp)

This repository contains a set of simulation demos combining classical `ns-3` networking with `qpp` (Quantum++) to prototype quantum network behaviors to varying degrees.

## ðŸ§  Structure

- `simulations/` â€” All simulation demos.
- `simulations/quantum_v1/` â€” First iteration quantum components (beginning to integrate more fully into ns3):
  - `1_quantum_state.h` â€” Represents shared quantum state (1+ qubits).
  - `1_quantum_state_registry.h` - Tracks all quantum states across the network, which is necessary for proper tracking of qubits/states that are entangled but at different nodes.
  - `1_quantum_state_registry.cc` - Implementation of methods for the `QuantumStateRegistry`
  - `1_qubit.h` â€” Lightweight handle for a single qubit.
  - `1_quantum_component.h` â€” Logic for qubit creation, gate application, and measurement. Subclasses `ns3::Object` and is intended to be aggregated with `Node`.
  - `1_quantum_channel.h` â€” Simulates quantum link delay and scheduling.
- `simulations/quantum_v0/` â€” Zeroth iteration quantum components (currently independent on ns3, but able to be scheduled by ns3's scheduler):
  - `0_quantum_state.h` â€” Represents shared quantum state (1+ qubits).
  - `0_qubit.h` â€” Lightweight handle for a single qubit.
  - `0_quantum_node.h` â€” Logic for qubit creation, gate application, and measurement.
  - `0_quantum_channel.h` â€” Simulates quantum link delay and scheduling.

Each class is implemented inline in its `.h` file to allow fast iteration and single-file simplicity.

## ðŸš€ Demos

### `00_classical_node_demo.cc`

A basic `ns-3` point-to-point network simulation that sends classical packets and logs when they're sent/received.

### `01_classical_node_quantum_condition_demo.cc`

A hybrid classical/quantum demo where a quantum measurement result conditions whether a classical packet is sent.

### `02_classical_node_quantum_state_demo.cc`

A fully classical `ns-3` setup that transmits a serialized random quantum state (ket) as a byte buffer and reconstructs it on the receiving end.

### `03_quantum_node_send_demo.cc`

The first fully quantum demo using custom `QuantumNode`, `QuantumChannel`, and `Qubit` classes. A qubit is created at Alice, a random gate is applied, and the resulting state is sent to Bob on a quantum channel with simulated link delay. Relies on `quantum_v0` files.

### `04_quantum_component_teleport_demo.cc`

A proper demo of teleportation with transmission of both qubits and classical bits. This is the first demo where ns3 nodes actually contain quantum behavior via a `QuantumComponent` class that replaces the previous `QuantumNode` class. NOTE: `QuantumChannel` is still a distinct class that uses the ns3 simulator scheduling mechanism, but is not in fact part of ns3's hierarchy. Relies on `quantum_v1` files.

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps

- Build `QuantumChannel` into ns3 more properly.
- Adding gate and measurement duration logic with scheduling.
- QKD demo and potentially class.
- Valuable metrics like entanglement entropy, fidelity, etc.
- Support for **quantum loss**, **fidelity decay**, and **channel noise**.
- Introduce **entanglement generation** and **Bell state transmission**.
- Add **entanglement-based protocols** (e.g., teleportation, superdense coding).
- Support **multi-qubit states**, distributed tracking, and **entanglement swapping**.
- Gradually transition to `*.cc`/`*.h` pairs and modular build for long-term scaling.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- C++20
- ns-3 (compiled with CMake, e.g. v3.44)
- Quantum++ (qpp) + Eigen + qasmtools (cloned locally)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
./03_quantum_node_send_demo
```

Use `std::cout` for output logging (preferred). To enable `NS_LOG`, set:

```bash
export NS_LOG="*=level_all"
```

or call `setenv(...)` in `main()`.
